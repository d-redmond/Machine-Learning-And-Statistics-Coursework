    "\n",
    "Confirmation bias, the tendency to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with one's existing beliefs. Confirmation bias cannot be eliminated, but it can be managed, for example, by education and training in critical thinking skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive biases are important variables in clinical decision-making by medical general practitioners (GPs) and medical specialists. Two important ones are confirmation bias and the overlapping availability bias. A GP may make a diagnosis early on during an examination, and then seek confirming evidence rather than falsifying evidence."

    "\n",
    "Automated bias is a tendency of humans to favor results or suggestions generated by automated systems and to ignore contradictory information made by non-automated systems, even if it is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation bias stems from the social psychology literature that found a bias in human-human interaction that showed that people assign more positive evaluations to decisions made by humans than to a neutral object.[2] The same type of positivity bias has been found for human-automation interaction,[3] where the automated decisions are rated more positively than neutral.[4] This has become a growing problem for decision making as intensive care units, nuclear power plants, and aircraft cockpits have increasingly integrated computerized system monitors and decision aids to mostly factor out possible human error."
